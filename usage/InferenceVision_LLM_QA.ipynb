        "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage large language models (LLMs) using the **InferenceVision** framework — now improved with a modular, clean design using the `chat_llm.py` helper module. The helper abstracts model loading, question answering, and interactive chatting, making your workflows simpler and more maintainable. Script demonstrates how to clone the fine-tuned InferenceVision LLM from Hugging Face, load the model and tokenizer, and interactively query it.\n",

        "This notebook supports two powerful language models within the InferenceVision framework: `pythia-1b` and `gpt-neo-1.3B`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **`pythia-1b`** model, part of the Pythia series, features around 1 billion parameters and is designed to capture complex language patterns and subtle contextual nuances. It excels at a variety of NLP tasks such as question answering and text generation, and can be fine-tuned on custom datasets to specialize in specific domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **`gpt-neo-1.3B`** model is a variant of the GPT-Neo architecture, with approximately 1.3 billion parameters. It offers a complementary approach with a robust transformer design optimized for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses across many NLP applications, including conversational AI and summarization.\n",

        "- **Thread-Safe Loading:** Avoid redundant loading when switching models.\n",
        "- **Interactive REPL:** A simple interactive loop lets you chat with the model live, with commands to customize behavior.\n"
